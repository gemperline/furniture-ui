        "Let me first rave about the delivery. Fast, courteous and left no mess. 5 stars!  The measurements on my couch are 97.5”L x 34”D. The performance fabric feels like it can stand up to some kids and pets, but I am still going to invest in a good washable cover. I like that it goes all the way to the floor, keeping toys and odds and ends from getting stuck underneath. The color is true to the item description. It is a low sitting couch and the seat comes to just below my knees, and I’m 5’1”. It’s perfect for us, but may be lower than is comfortable for a tall family. The cushioning is firm yet comfortable. It comes with two seat cushions and two back cushions. I trading the back cushions out for throw pillows I have already. Overall this is a good looking couch with features that make me expect it to hold up well over time.",
